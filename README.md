# Case Study: Hacker Statistics

## The scenario
We're walking up the empire state building and we're playing a game. 

## The rules
1. We throw a die one hundred times. 
2. If it's 1 or 2 you'll go one step down.
3. If it's 3, 4 or 5 you'll go one step up.
4. If you throw a 6, you'll throw the diw again and will walk up the resulting number of steps.
5. You can not go lower than step number 0.
6. You admit you're a bit clumsy and have a chance of 0.1% of falling down the stais when you make a move - Falling down means that you have to start again from step 0.

## The bet
With all thin in mind, you bet with you friend that you'll reach 60 steps high.

## The question
What is the chance that you will win this bet?

## How to solve? 
1. Analitically Solution - Calculate the chance analytically using equasions.
2. Hacker Statistics - Simulate this process thousands of times, and see in what fraction of the simulations that you will reach 60 steps.
